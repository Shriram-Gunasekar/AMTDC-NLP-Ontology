Aim was to fast track engineering design processes with AI algorithms for selection of machining tools using NLP and Graph ontologies.

Done using specialized graph ontologies for more than 30gb of text data using Neo4j 

• Used BERT Models to structure optimized Graph Queries in the Cypher language

• Used in-database ML query optimization to achieve 34% decrease in query response time

• Achieved less than 10% error rate in responses
